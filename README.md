# Engineering Challenge Repository

This repository contains solutions for an engineering challenge, which includes both programming and database management tasks.

## Contents

- `challenge_1.py`: A Python script designed to connect to the Stack Exchange API, retrieve data, and perform data analysis as per the challenge requirements.

- `challenge_2.sql`: A SQL script containing queries to interact with a PostgreSQL database. It includes the creation of tables, insertion of data, and complex queries to extract specific information about flights, airlines, and airports.

- `Challenge_Engineer.pdf`: The original challenge document that outlines the tasks and requirements for the programming and SQL challenges.

## How to Use

### Python Script
To run the Python script, ensure you have Python installed on your system and execute the script using:

```sh
python challenge_1.py

### SQL Script
The `challenge_2.sql` file contains SQL statements for setting up your database schema and inserting test data. To use these statements:

- Open your PostgreSQL client.
- Connect to your chosen database.
- Execute the SQL statements from `challenge_2.sql` to create the tables and populate them with data.

These steps will prepare your local database environment, allowing you to perform the necessary queries to analyze data as specified in the engineering challenge.
